# The-Sock-Problem
**Note:** The programs can be run in jupyter notebook with the statement %run program_name
## Task 1 Part 1
### Program name: *compute_pairs*
**Description:** This program outputs number of pairs in each color 1, 2, 3.
## Task 1 Part 2 - Simulation
### Program name: *simulation*
**Description:** This program outputs 100 lists. Each list with 6 numbers. The 6 numbers represent number of pairs produced against 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 colours.
## Task 1 Part 3 - Visualisation
### Program name: *visualisation*
**Description:** This program outputs two lists i.e., number of pairs and number of colors and then plots a graph of number of pairs against number of colours.
## Task 1 Part 4 - Interpretation
### Program name: *interpretation*
**Description:** This program applies linear regression to number of pairs (y-axis) and number of colors (x-axis) graph and outputs linear model with slope and y-intercept. From this model it computes number of pairs at 30 colours. The answer cannot be accurate as process is random.
